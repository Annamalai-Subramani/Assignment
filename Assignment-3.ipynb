    "2.Modularity: Functions break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable units. \n",
    "\n",
    "3.Abstraction: Functions provide a higher level of abstraction, allowing you to use pre-defined functions without worrying about their implementation details.You can use pre-defined functions to perform common actions, such as adding numbers or printing text, without understanding all the technical details.\n",
