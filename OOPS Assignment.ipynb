    "The primary goal of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to model real-world entities and their interactions in software through the use of objects, encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism, resulting in more organized, reusable, and maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Encapsulation: OOP encourages encapsulating data (attributes or properties) and the methods (functions or procedures) that operate on that data within a single unit called an \"object.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable components. In OOP, classes serve as blueprints or templates for creating objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows you to create new classes (derived or child classes) based on existing classes (base or parent classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "4)Polymorphism: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common base class. "
